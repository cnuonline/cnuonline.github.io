Picking right tool of Layer 7 & Layer 4 network tools (load balancer, traffic routes)  is challenging especially choosing the opensource, cloud agnostic tech stack . want to share the knowledge on selecting the tools with certain criteria
Criteria:
1. List down the various interaction points - mobile, web, api, intranet traffic, external vendors/parties
2. List down the applications and source of the traffic
3. List down the apps/source which requires strict validation, firewall, token validation, trusted sources(intranet calls) 
Something which can be visualized as a matrix . (Ideally , we require cube kind of a model to represent)



Possible tools which has opensource & enterprise version support.

Take a decision based on your budget or already existing relationship with the product tools.
