Ocean of data and no control over the events and no workflow for campaign!
===================


You spent an hour for adding google analytics code to your website or mobile app and get relaxed saying, i m done with analytics.
You will be getting a report saying , i know how many people are visiting , how much type each user is spending , which geo locations are having much traction.  You feel, everything is in place. 

How can i bring back my visited lead / customer.  I have plenty of info and use cases of product/services , but user is not yet re-visited.  How can we share the product info and features through a simple campaign where he has left.  These are the baby steps to build the trust , which in turn converts into Customers and potential viral referrals .

What other ways we can have more control over the analytics data and connect better.

Let's have google analytics kind of public cloud solution should be available in your own hosting or it should be able to provide transparency on the data which you are pumping through app.
This will help us to achieve in creating custom pipeline of events and generate a next level engagement through email/sms/notifications .
I tried with a pilot of private analytics with CustomerEngagePro [https://www.customerengagepro.com] which helped me to create a pipeline . Now i am relaxed back at my couch. I am able to educated my leads about my product and has clear line drawn.

Interestingly,  few of my old clients are looking wants a similar solution for their e-commerce and they want to shorten the sales closure through a petty discounts by sharing custom discount code for the bounced leads. They have leveraged the solution and i feel this is going to provide high ROI.

Also, the term predictive term is still on the books , now we are going to have a chance to implement the Predictive analytics on your own hosted analytics. This is much more meaningful and with a high confidence , all the dots are connected.

At the end, their is no meaning for the ocean of data with bunch of email reports. Ability to connect the bounced leads with simple decision making on the captured analytics data will show the light in the tunnel.

Feel free to reach me the email id mentioned in the footer. I believe simple thought process and brain storm will cross the hurdles.
