What happened ? -->Descriptive Analytics.  Why did it happened ? Diagnostic Analytics or Actionable Analytics

There are many more  data analytics tools in the market (Public and private) which helps you to acquire the data from various sources (Web,Mobile, Salesforce, Sharepoint) . Generating a very nice dashboard on historical data by doing various queries , combining multiple datasources is very much motivating and everyone loves.

**Diagnose the behaviour:**

What next ? you will generate for every month /period ? It doesn't help us to watching the ocean of data. Now question raises, why did it happen ? Lets diagnose it .

Let's talk with an e-commerce example. Your e-commerce site is very good visitors . Say 5000 new visitors.  Every visitor is going to a mobile product and then accessories .  He is comparing the features , prices and exiting your shop.  Now figure out why the customer is navigating in the same steps/clicks ? Did he misunderstood the content ? is our site usability has any issues , though we showed discount ?

Now ,try to fix the content /content display issues, if not make a simple video.  If we still have issues, introduce chat window & talk to the live customers.  

**Diagnose the business strategy** 
But still visitors are clicking in the same pattern, now it is the time to play with price , discounts. Any business owner, doesn't like it.  
It's time to think win-win strategy for customer & Business owner. Let's introduce the mobile product with accessories as bundle. This can provide a opportunity for business owner to save money on shipping , inventory ageing . Customers will have option to taste a better value for the purchases.

**Diagnose and make it as actionable events:**

Diagnosing the click events, page events , visitors entry and exits  will fall into historical data which is descriptive analytics. Adding event triggers on a specific section of the page, widget will help us to dig into deeper insights . 

Let's take an example of e-commerce data.  Given a chance, everyone wants to keep a trigger event in Add Cart button, Check Out button. This helps us to figure out Cart Abandonment (cart dropout's )and can correct ourselves. Current market e-commerce industry is triggering an discount to the specific visitor and closing the sales. Only the e-commerce companies who has deep pockets are able to accomplish. Medium & Small business are still struggling to close the sales of the Cart Abandonment's. Re-marketing is not the solution and it may extends the sales cycles.

**Focus on meaningful visitor engagement:**
Apart from the immediate discounts on every cart abandonment's , visitors need a deeper education on comparing the products, new product launches, upcoming product launches, bundle product savings. 
All this can happen , if we know the visitors history of events on the site and run a custom campaign for cart dropout's , product info, upcoming products . This will be more meaningful of engaging the visitors/customers.  Without knowing , all the e-commerce businesses can run on the event driven actionable analytics. 

Definitely , e-commerce business will require the private data analytics which can have full control over the data. Among them, [CustomerEngagePro](https://www.customerengagepro.com) is one of the cost-effective private data analytics to reach the goals
