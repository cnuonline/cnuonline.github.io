**ReachJS  vs AngularJS Comparison - Which one to choose ? **

Always tough to choose , which UI framework is good for Digital Web App Development ? Most of the decisions are being taken on the first page of Google search results. Most of the issues will be realised at 50% of the work stage.

Both the frameworks will complement each other, but it has  slight difference based on the Framework stack . It could be Node JS or Java or DotNet or PHP stack.

Two questions to be answered ?

 1. Are you duplicating any UI logic in Frontend and Backend ?
 2. Do you have similar experience for Mobile app and Desktop web with business logic tied up at the front end ?

What was answer to the first question ?
If yes, do you think the logic can be moved to backend ? If yes, you can choose Angular js or backbone js or polymer js.
If no,  what was stack of your backend ? Built with Java or DotNot or Node JS ? what was the roadmap on your backend? If the roadmap is to move into NodeJS backend, i strongly recommend to have React JS framework. For other backend stack, you need to move back to API gateway and it should be language agnostics for implementing the API with any language.  Make use of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with [ReactJS](https://angularjs.org/) reusable codebase.

What was answer to the Second question ? (Do you have similar experience for Mobile app and Desktop web with business logic tied up at the front end ?)
If yes,  make use of reactJS which works on Mobile app and Desktop app with shared business logic.  Of course,  stack should be NodeJS.  
If no, you have a choice to go with Angular JS with different templates. Your roadmap needs to be revisited based on the Hybrid app Development or Native App Development.

Both the frameworks are small in size and Component based Architecture. Both are meant to have higher performance.

Miscellaneous Comparison.

| Feature | [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) | [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) |
|-- |--|--|
| Programming Language | JavaScript | TypeScript |
|Learning Curve|Moderate| Steep|
|Databinding|Uni-Directional|Bi Directional|
|Abstraction|Medium|Strong|
|Maintain Upgrades|Seamless|Changing rapidly Major versions|
|Support By|FaceBook| Google|

Conclusion:
Alway's think about the maintainability & upgrades with seamless approach. Your custom components should not be effected by upgrading the typescript or any lib versions. Abstraction should help us to deal with seamless browser versions , OS versions and their upgrades. Keeping in this mind, ReactJS will be a closure option from the long term perspective.
